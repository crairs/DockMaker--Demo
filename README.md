## DockMaker

As part of customers cloud journey many of the services used and connected as part of defined ETL workflows are present and managed by the cloud (such as storage buckets, relational & analytical databases, messaging systems, etc.).
It means Pentaho is required to:
* Sit close to these services for security and performance considerations
* Ability to scale up and down based on requirements
* In short, adjust to the deployment pattern used as standard in the enterprise
Hitachi Vantara doesnâ€™t provide an out of the box container image mainly because we believe that each customer and each deployment has specific needs. Our approach is to provide this workshop as a guide for your very specific Pentaho on Kubernetes journey.

DockMaker is a command line tool used to create containers for Pentaho products:
